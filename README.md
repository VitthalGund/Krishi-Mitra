# 🌾 Krishi-Mitra (कृषि-मित्र)

### *Revolutionizing Agri-Finance through Voice-First Agentic AI & India Stack Integration*

**Krishi-Mitra** is a sovereign, voice-first "Relationship Manager" built to solve the systemic financial exclusion of India’s **120 million smallholder families**. By replacing complex, paper-heavy loan applications with natural, multilingual voice conversations, the platform bridges the gap between document-illiterate farmers and the formal banking sector.

Leveraging India’s **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**, Krishi-Mitra orchestrates a multi-agent AI system that integrates directly with **AgriStack** to automate land verification and credit scoring, aiming to provide "in-principle" loan decisions in under **30 minutes**.

## 🎯 Strategic Project Pillars

* **Vision**: To create an inclusive digital ecosystem where every smallholder farmer in India accesses affordable, instant credit via voice AI, transforming agriculture into a resilient, sustainable pillar of economic growth.

* **Mission**: Leverage open-source AI and government digital infrastructure to automate loan processes, reduce financial exclusion by **30% in pilot regions**, and foster equitable rural development by 2030.

* **Core Goals**: Achieve **85%+ accuracy** in AI credit scoring, process **1,000+ loans monthly** at launch, and integrate with national schemes like **PM-KISAN** for seamless disbursals, targeting a **15% NPA reduction** for partner lenders.

## 🛑 The Problem: The Credit Exclusion Crisis

Despite extensive rural banking networks, the current agri-credit system remains inaccessible to over half of the farming population due to three core systemic failures:

1. **Extreme Financial Exclusion**: Statistics indicate that **51.4% of farmer families** remain excluded from formal credit systems. Approximately **23.4% of agricultural credit** in India still comes from high-interest informal sources like moneylenders.

2. **The Information Gap**: A staggering **92.5% of farmers** cite "lack of information regarding institutions providing loans" as their primary challenge.

3. **Low Literacy & Literacy Barriers**: The average financial literacy score among Indian farmers is only **33%**, making text-heavy banking apps and complex documentation impossible to navigate.

4. **Outdated Risk Models**: Reliance on static credit scores excludes "invisible" borrowers who have assets but no formal credit history.

## 🚀 Product Solution: "Krishi-Sahayak" Omni-Channel AI

Krishi-Mitra serves as a **Multimodal AI Co-pilot** that acts as an educated assistant sitting next to the farmer, helping them understand and fill out complex banking forms.

### 1. Multi-Product Portfolio

The system is designed to handle diverse agricultural financial needs:

* **Kisan Credit Card (KCC)**: Short-term credit for seeds/fertilizers based on land area and crop season.
* **Farm Mechanization Loans**: Term loans for buying tractors, irrigation systems, or drones.
* **Allied Sector Loans**: Credit for income diversification in Dairy, Fishery, or Poultry.

### 2. "Zero-Touch" Agentic Architecture

Krishi-Mitra utilizes **Agentic AI** to manage the entire loan lifecycle through specialized "Worker Agents" coordinated by a "Master Agent":

* **KYC Agent**: Automated Aadhaar/identity verification.

* **AgriStack Agent**: Fetches real-time land records, geo-referenced maps, and crop-sown history via the government's **Unified Farmer Service Interface (UFSI)**.

* **Scoring Agent**: Ingests alternative data, including **NASA MODIS satellite imagery** and weather patterns, to predict yield risk and creditworthiness.

* **Underwriting Agent**: Applies bank-specific logic and dynamic risk-adjusted interest rates (9-12%).
